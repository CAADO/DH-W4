Excel went ezpz, I was able to move through this quickly

no errors in section 1, other then remembering to fire lines in r when you're selecting the line in question. Hitting enter and then run will put you on the next line, and not work properly. 

I started looking at race in the given word selection database. The whole process went quite smoothly, and I spent some time poking around. At this time, the paper seems much more conserned with indians and indianness then whiteness or blackness, whith whiteness being the more common of the latter two.

In creating my own corpus, I think something instantly went wrong. I downloaded files on motorcycles, but while I was able to see within the convirted Json file the links to pictures, the containing text really wasn't present. I honestly have no idea how to fix it, and after a couple basic attempts, I decied to just stick my broken data in Val anyway, to see if anything interesting popped up. 
I also had to go back to week 2 a bit, but I'm not sure if I didn't understand a step or something, but I don't see how the ca.py file will ever actually give me understandable text. Maybe it's the subject I was searching?

Making my own stuff with AntConc just felt... smooth. All of the tools I've been using for this class, and actually my other class all have started to feel... simmilar? they all sort of function the same way, and I'm getting an inututive grasp of it. I just honestly skipped half the tutorial and played a fair bit. 
I'm not sure what to upload as my result for AntConc? I guess I will just upload the text files I used? I saved the result of one search.

the original download link for the topic modeling stuff on windows didn't work for me, so I went and got it from git 

I had to google what a directory was

ok I take it back, I'm not uploading all of the text files, that was a pointless idea seeing as I need to use them here anyway.

topic modeling seems smooth so far. I'm going to slap it in excel, and maybe powerBI.

I don't really want to do *more* R right now, so I'm going to skip the extra stuff. The link is good though.

Pivot table charts are interesting for this. What do I need to understand this? probably basic subject matter knowlege, and some data cleaning, if we're being honest. Playing with blind data is kinda fun, but not very historically useful.

onto the r stuff 

the r script seemed to fail, but I was able to get it to load the data anyway through selection, so maybe it did work? 

errors everywhere, but it seems to be working fine, so...

trying a couple of fixes, my R seems to be missing some installs. 

yea, everything seems to have gone wrong here. My R is throwing out "could not find function "read_cvs" that's so basic idk how to fix it. 

I suppose this is my first stoppage.
